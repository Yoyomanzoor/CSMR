### Structure of class
- We will meet virtually every 2 weeks, as schedules permit. Each meeting, we will cover a concept, e.g. programming, biology, or research.
- I will provide material, resources, and work to do before the next session. Coding is learned by doing, so the majority of this will be coding exercises. I might also send articles or readings.
- We will use Rosalind to learn the basics of bioinformatics.

### Python
If you have already used python in the past, you are free to continue to use it through your current setup. However, I do require you use [virtual environments](https://realpython.com/python-virtual-environments-a-primer/) (I recommend [conda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/getting-started.html)).

Else, here are some options you may use to install python:
- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) should provide you will all the tools you might need for data science, including Python, Spyder, and jupyter notebooks
- [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is a full feature IDE that should work out-of-the-box
- You can choose to work via [conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/) out of terminal. 
  - For Windows, I recommend [Git Bash](https://gitforwindows.org/)
  - Mac and Linux come with terminals natively
  - Through a terminal, you will need to [create an environment with python](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/4.6.0/_downloads/52a95608c49671267e40c689e0bc00ca/conda-cheatsheet.pdf)
  - Activate the environment and install [jupyter](https://anaconda.org/anaconda/jupyter)
